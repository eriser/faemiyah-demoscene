`dnload.py` is a script for generating minimal ELF binaries. It serves no practical real-world use case, but can be utilized to create

= Acknowledgements =

This script would not have been possible without the prior work done by various other parties. Especially the following parties deserve kudos for their efforts:
  * *Marq/Fit* for the original unpack header and dlopen/dlsym implementation.
  * *parcelshit* and *las/Mercury* for the original ELF32 import-by hash algorithm.
  * *hymy* and *Ye Olde Laptops Posse* for earlier forays into manual ELF32 header construction.
  * *viznut/PWP* for the series _Experimental music from very short C programs_, a snipped of which is used in one of the examples.

The list might be missing some parties, that are thus not getting the credit they deserve. If you notice this, please help correct the error(s).

All contained code is licenced under the [http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause new BSD licence].

Note that this licence only pertains to the code of the script(s) themselves. Just like building a binary with a compiler imposes no restriction to the binary itself, whatever the user decides to do with the script(s) is completely up to the user.

And to be honest, whatever anyone decides to do with the anything here is pretty much free game. You can't honestly except us to care. If you improve on the mechanisms, I'd probably prefer to incorporate the improvements. But if not, hey, then not.

= Usage =

'dnload.py' is a self-contained Python script that requires no specific external packages to be installed into the system. It should work both on Python 2.7.x and 3.x branches.

The script has two purposes.
  * First and foremost, it is intended to bridge the efforts of a team working on multiple platforms and operating systems, possibly creating intro code in environments unrelated to the final target platform.
  * Second, it is intended to be used for creating an "as-small-as-possible" final binary to be released on supported operating systems.

== Requirements ==

The bridging header file should be generatable on FreeBSD, Linux, Windows, and possibly various unmentioned `*`nix platforms with a up-to-date Python installation.

Generating a final binary is supported on FreeBSD and Linux. Due to practical purposes (i.e. the OS of choice of the author), the primary target operating system is FreeBSD.

== Getting started ==

To get the list of all possible command line arguments, just run the script with `--help`.
